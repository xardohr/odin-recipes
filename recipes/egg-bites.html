        <h3>Whether you fell in <strong>love</strong> with egg bites at Starbucks over the past few years or are ready to discover them now, it's time to add these genius protein-packed breakfasts to your morning routine. </h3>
        <h4 class="ing-steps">Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Nonstick pan spray</li>
            <li>12 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup milk (whole, skim, or 2%)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="ing-steps">Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Generously spray the wells of a 12-cup standard muffin tin with nonstick pan spray.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a large bowl and add the milk, salt, and pepper. Whisk until the mixture is homogeneous and there are no streaks of unincorporated egg whites.</li>
            <li>Evenly distribute the mixture into the wells of the muffin tin filling them about three-fours of the way to the top (about 1/4 cup per well). Bake until the egg bites puff up and the tops no longer look wet, 25 to 30 minutes. (The egg bites will puff dramatically in the oven but collapse once cooled.)</li>
            <li>Let cool slightly, then remove the egg bites from the tin using an offset spatula or butter knife. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
